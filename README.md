# fashion-mnist
This is the first neural network I've created in my ML journey. It classifies images of clothing items. The input layer is an array of grayscale values that was flattened and normalized for the model. Then, it was passed through a hidden layer to increase the complexity of the network. Finally, the output layer had 10 neurons to represent the 10 different possible class/item types. The output layer returned the probabilities of each class type. I used these probabilities to choose the largest value in order to classify the image type using the neural network.
